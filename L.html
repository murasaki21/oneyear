  <div class="header">Letting People Braid My Hair</div>
  <p>At the end of my junior year, one of my guy friends said that he can braid hair. Because I didn't believe him and I had the easiest hair to braid, he decided to put random braids into my hair. This carried into Senior Year where he would braid my hair or give me a braided rat tail during lunch.
