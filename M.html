  <div class="header">My Friend Accidentally Asked Me Out to Ball</div>
  <p>1/2018: When one of my close friends asked me about my plans for Senior Ball, I told him I was planning on going with friends since I was pretty sure no one would ask me out. Afterwards, I asked him about his plans and he wanted to ask a girl out to Senior Ball (he didn't say who it was), but was unsure if he would.</p>

    <p>3/2018: It was the last full day of the quarter as well as one month before Ball and I was spending my lunch with him (we have been having lunch together for this entire quarter, so it's pretty normal by this point). While eating, I asked him if he was still going to ask the girl to go to Ball. Unexpectedly, while he was on his phone, he casually asked me if I wanted to go to Ball with him. I was confused at first and asked him if he was being serious. Because he didn't realize that he asked me to Ball, he responded, "sure, why not." And so, I said yes to him at the moment. Later on, I found out the girl he wanted to ask originally was me, but he was unsure due to my plans at the time.</p>
