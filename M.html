<h2>My Friend Accidentally Asked Me Out to Ball</h2>
<p>1/2018: One of my close friends said he wanted to ask a girl out to Senior Ball (he didn't say who it was), but was unsure if he would. When he asked me about my plans, I told him I was planning on going with friends since I was pretty sure no one would ask me out.</p>

<p>3/2018: It was the last full day of the quarter as well as one month before Ball and I was spending my lunch with him (we have been having lunch together for this entire quarter, so it's pretty normal by this point). While eating, I asked him if he was still going to ask the girl to go to Ball. Unexpectedly, he casually asked me if I wanted to go to Ball with him. I was confused at first and asked him if he was being serious, (He also didn't realize he did it subconsciously) and he responded yes. Thus, I said yes to him at the moment. Later on, I found out the girl he wanted to ask originally was me but was unsure due to my plans at the time.</p>
