<div class="header">Catching People Sneaking in Marijuana on the Senior Year Fieldtrip</div>
<p>After we were seated on the buses (there were eight) for the Senior year fieldtrip to Disneyland, the buses were schedule to start driving, however, one of the buses had a distinct odor of THC, resulting in teachers and supervisors having to bag check the students on the bus. This searching delayed the trip by an hour. Ironically, when we were getting seated to return back home, a different person was caught carrying THC with them. Either way, Disneyland was a lot of fun :)</p>
