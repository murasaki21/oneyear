    <p>From the year before, I was in Advanced Video Productions and was assigned to create a public service announcement (PSA), so I decided to make a one minute PSA for Directing Change, an oganization focused on educating and promoting the importance of mental health to young people. After writing, producing, editting, and submitting the PSA for that year, I found out a couple weeks later that I placed third place and earned $250 for that video.</p>
    <p>Fast foward one year: I found out Directing Change was hosting another video contest. Because I wasn't in Video Productions for this year, I had more time to make videos I wanted to make. And because I enjoyed producing a PSA for Directing Change before, I decided to make another one to submit for this year. Without the control of a teacher, I felt more free and passionate about the piece I was producing. And with the experience from the previous year, I was able to better anticipate problems and solve them more quickly as well. When the deadline was coming closer, I submitted the video with hope and doubt to win again. On the day the results were out, I actually didn't get any notification about winning. I didn't know that I won third place again and earned $250 again until my friend (she was also in the contest, but competed for a different group) congratulated me for winning. </p>
