<div class="header">Lantern Crafting at Craft Club</div>
<p> During my Senior year, I was part of a small club where the members got together roughly twice a month to do quick DIY projects such as origami, sewing, clay keychains, etc., hence the name Craft Club. As part of the cabinet for this club, two girls and I were responsible for looking for new projects/crafts to do. The last couple projects we had unexpectedly took several meetings to finish, so I wanted to do a project that was quick enough to be done in 1 1/2 hours or one meeting. While looking for craft ideas, I stumbled upon a quick and easy YouTube tutorial on paper lanterns and with Lunar New Year approaching, I thought it was fitting to suggest. The two other girls agreed upon it and when the day of the meeting came, the paper lanterns were a success and were able to be done in one meeting. After several supposedly easy projects that took a while to finish, it was refreshing to have such a quick project. </p>
