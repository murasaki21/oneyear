<div class="header">Hating Government Homework</div>
<p>Government was a required class that I took during my last quarter and there were two teachers teaching the regular course: The leniant one who gave little work and the strict one who assigned at least 1 and half hours of homework daily(it wasn't hard but tedious and monotonous), required community involvment, and a 5 page nonbiased research paper with an argumentative topic. I think you can tell who I got. From a college standpoint, it's not that much work, but with Senioritis at its peak during the last quarter, it was hell. The topics were actually quite interesting though, it was just the the tedious amount of work. I also stayed up till 4:40 am to finish up that stupid paper.</p>
