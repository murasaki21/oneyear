  <div class="header">I Fell in Love with Mario Kart DS Again</div>
  <p>At the end of my 2nd quarter, because all of friends and I had Mario Kart DS 2005, we decided to all play compete in Mario Kart. Because most of us were amateurs/haven't played in years (which includes me), it was pretty fun to play with each
    other. Because one of my friends played Mario Kart quite often, he was teaching some of us how to drift. For me, because I never finished the game (because I didn't know about drifting until then),
    throughout the rest of the school year, I set my mind on finishing the game. I later found out the version I had wasn't authentic and thus, I was never able to truly finish the game...</p>
