<p> Our school's theater students were hosting a haunted house and my friends wanted to go. Because I hate horror films, I was hesitant on going, but when my friends knew I never been inside a haunted house, they kept pursauding for me to come. Eventually, I decided to give in because I knew I wouldn't be going in alone and I wanted to spend time with them since it was our last year. On the day of the event, before we entered, about half of us were nervous (that includes me), so one of our friends had an idea and told us to pair up for emotional stability purposes (aka if one of faints, they aren't left behind). I don't really remember the details of being inside other than being scared enough that I couldn't move without my partner guiding/pushing me to move foward. At the very end though, there was a jump scare at the exit causing my partner to run into a pillar near the exit. After the whole experience, we all got together to take pictures at their photobooth with masks and other some other props. Overall, while it was scary, I was glad to go to experience my first haunted house with them.</p>
